# danik_hybrid_cores - starts the game of a MiSTer hybrid core when its core is loaded
#
# https://github.com/ItsDanik/Hybrid_MiSTer
#
# A hybrid core is an FPGA core whose game runs on the MiSTer's ARM CPU. This
# script is what connects the two: a small daemon watches which core is loaded
# (/tmp/CORENAME) and runs /media/fat/games/<core name>/danik_hybrid_launch.sh while it is.
# The launcher is stopped when another core is loaded.
#
#   Run it once from the MiSTer's Scripts menu. That starts the daemon and
#   adds it to /media/fat/linux/user-startup.sh, so it also runs after a
#   reboot. Running it again is harmless.
#
#   Every hybrid core ships this file twice: as Scripts/danik_hybrid_cores.sh
#   and as a copy in its games folder. The copy with the highest VERSION is
#   the one that runs: the daemon installs it over the file in Scripts by
#   itself, so an older core installed later doesn't bring an old launcher
#   back and nothing has to be run again after an update.
#
# usage: danik_hybrid_cores.sh            set up (as from the Scripts menu)
#        danik_hybrid_cores.sh start      start the daemon (what user-startup.sh calls)
#        danik_hybrid_cores.sh stop       stop the daemon and the running game
#        danik_hybrid_cores.sh remove     stop it and take it out of user-startup.sh
#        danik_hybrid_cores.sh status
#
# For a danik_hybrid_launch.sh:
#   - it is run with bash in its own session; its output goes to the log below
#   - on a core switch its whole process group gets SIGTERM, and SIGKILL two
#     seconds later if it is still there
#   - when it exits it is not started again until the core is loaded again
#     (to leave, a launcher loads the menu core)
#
# The whole script is read before anything runs (see the last line), so it can
# be replaced while the daemon is running; the daemon restarts itself with the
# new file as soon as no game is running.
#
# The way of launching a hybrid core (a daemon registered in user-startup.sh
# that watches /tmp/CORENAME and runs a script from the core's games folder)
# comes from MiSTer Frontier's Master_Daemon by MiSTer Organize:
# https://github.com/MiSTerOrganize/MiSTer_Frontier (GPL-3.0). Thank you for
# the inspiration. This script is written from scratch and does not need
# MiSTer Frontier.
